# Nokia5110
Simple Arduino (Uno) library for Nokia5110 LCD modules, e.g. as available at:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168

Very heavily based on example code by Jim Lindblom from https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/graphic-lcd-hookup-guide (it's essentially a cut down version of that code, in a library).
